# Decision Log: Go-Output v2 Migration

## Overview
This document tracks key decisions made during the requirements phase of the go-output v2 migration.

---

## Decision 1: Scope of Testing Requirements

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Decision:** Focus on functional testing with manual validation, defer automated golden file testing

**Context:**
- Design review agents recommended extensive automated testing (golden files, CI/CD matrix, benchmarking)
- Current project has existing CI/CD infrastructure
- Windows compilation issue in v1 is known to be resolved in v2
- Performance of v2 is known to be equivalent or better than v1

**Options Considered:**
1. Implement comprehensive automated testing suite with golden files
2. Rely on existing tests + manual validation for migration
3. Hybrid approach with some automated tests

**Decision Made:** Option 2 - Existing tests + manual validation

**Rationale:**
- Windows issue was a v1 compilation bug, not a runtime issue - resolved in v2
- Performance differences negligible compared to actual CloudFormation API calls
- Manual testing acceptable for initial migration
- Golden file testing and additional automation can be added later if needed
- Existing CI/CD infrastructure already validates cross-platform builds
- Focus development effort on migration implementation rather than test infrastructure

**Implications:**
- Requirements simplified to focus on functional equivalence
- Vague terms like "correctly" and "appropriately" acceptable with understanding of manual validation
- Developer responsible for manual verification of output across formats
- Future work item: Consider automated snapshot testing if regressions occur

## Decision 2: Rollback Strategy

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Decision:** Use standard git revert/fix-forward approach

**Context:**
- Design review recommended formal rollback strategy with feature flags
- This is a dependency update, not a feature with gradual rollout needs

**Options Considered:**
1. Feature flag to toggle v1/v2 at runtime
2. Maintain parallel v1/v2 implementations
3. Standard git revert/fix-forward

**Decision Made:** Option 3 - Standard approach

**Rationale:**
- go-output is an internal dependency, not user-facing feature
- Standard git practices sufficient for dependency updates
- Rollback is simply reverting commit or pinning to v1.5.1 in go.mod
- Fix-forward preferred for any issues found
- Overhead of feature flags not justified for this change

**Implications:**
- No rollback requirements needed in document
- Emergency procedure: `git revert <commit>` or update go.mod to pin v1.5.1
- Any issues addressed through normal bug fix process

---

## Decision 3: Windows Platform Testing

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Decision:** Include Windows in testing scope, but no special investigation needed

**Context:**
- Git history shows: "Pin to older version of go-output to ensure windows builds work"
- This was a known v1 compilation issue
- v2 resolves this issue

**Options Considered:**
1. Deep investigation of v1 Windows issue before proceeding
2. Trust v2 resolves it, include Windows in standard testing
3. Exclude Windows from initial migration

**Decision Made:** Option 2 - Trust v2, test Windows normally

**Rationale:**
- Issue was v1-specific compilation problem, not runtime behavior
- v2 architecture doesn't have this issue
- Windows included in platform testing requirements
- Existing CI/CD validates Windows builds

**Implications:**
- Requirements updated to include Windows in platform testing (12.7)
- No root cause investigation needed
- Standard cross-platform testing sufficient

---

## Decision 4: Array Handling Optimization

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Decision:** Make array handling optimization optional, keep GetSeparator() method

**Context:**
- v2.2.1 supports automatic array handling with format-appropriate separators
- Existing code uses GetSeparator() + strings.Join() pattern
- Requirement 6 had conflicting guidance

**Options Considered:**
1. Mandate replacing all GetSeparator() usage with arrays
2. Keep GetSeparator(), use arrays only where beneficial
3. Remove GetSeparator() entirely

**Decision Made:** Option 2 - Hybrid approach

**Rationale:**
- GetSeparator() is working code with no issues
- Array handling is a nice-to-have optimization, not required
- Can migrate opportunistically where it improves code
- Maintains flexibility and incremental improvement

**Implications:**
- Requirement 6.2 keeps "where appropriate" qualifier
- Requirement 6.4 maintains GetSeparator() method
- Developer decides per-case which approach is better
- Both patterns acceptable in final code

---

## Decision 5: Migration to Better v2 Practices

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Decision:** Adopt v2 best practices over minimal conversion

**Context:**
- Requirements could take minimal conversion approach (1:1 mapping)
- Alternative is to leverage v2's improved patterns (Builder, functional options, data pipelines)

**Options Considered:**
1. Minimal migration: Direct 1:1 replacements only
2. Best practices: Adopt v2's improved patterns
3. Hybrid: Minimal now, improvements later

**Decision Made:** Option 2 - Best practices migration

**Rationale:**
- v2's Builder pattern eliminates global state
- Functional options more maintainable than settings objects
- Data pipelines superior to byte transformers for sorting/filtering
- Better to migrate once to good patterns than migrate twice
- Code quality improvement justifies slightly more effort

**Implications:**
- Requirements specify Builder pattern usage (Requirement 4)
- Requirements specify functional options (Requirement 5)
- Requirements prefer data pipelines for sorting (Requirement 8)
- Slightly more refactoring needed, but better end result
- Code will follow v2 idiomatic patterns

## Decision 6: Inline Styling Migration

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Decision:** Use v2.2.1's stateless styling functions

**Context:**
- v1 uses outputsettings.StringWarningInline() pattern
- v2.2.1 added output.StyleWarning() as direct replacement

**Options Considered:**
1. Use fatih/color directly (workaround)
2. Use Field.Formatter with ANSI codes
3. Use v2.2.1's StyleWarning() functions

**Decision Made:** Option 3 - v2.2.1 styling functions

**Rationale:**
- Direct replacement available in v2.2.1
- No workarounds needed
- Stateless functions (thread-safe)
- Consistent with v2 architecture

**Implications:**
- Straightforward find-replace migration
- No additional dependencies needed
- Requirement 2 specifies exact replacements
- Code will be cleaner and more maintainable

## Questions and Answers

### Q1: Should we implement golden file testing?
**A:** No, not at this stage. Manual testing is sufficient for initial migration. Can add automated snapshot testing later if regressions become an issue.

### Q2: Do we need to investigate the Windows compilation bug?
**A:** No, it was a known v1 issue that's resolved in v2. Just include Windows in standard platform testing.

### Q3: How do we handle rollback if issues are found?
**A:** Standard git revert or update go.mod to pin previous version. Fix-forward for any bugs.

### Q4: Should we use arrays or GetSeparator() for multi-value cells?
**A:** Both are acceptable. Use arrays where it improves code, keep GetSeparator() where it's already working fine.

### Q5: How detailed should test validation be?
**A:** Functional equivalence is the goal. Output should have same data, structure, and formatting intent. Exact byte-for-byte match not required.

## Future Considerations

Items identified but deferred:

1. **Automated Snapshot Testing**: Consider implementing if manual testing proves insufficient or regressions occur
2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Could add benchmarks if performance concerns arise
3. **Array Handling Optimization**: Opportunity to refactor GetSeparator() usage to arrays in future cleanup
4. **Enhanced Collapsible Content**: v2 supports collapsible fields - could enhance drift detection UX
5. **Data Pipeline Usage**: Could leverage v2's data pipelines for more complex filtering/aggregation in future features
