## Quick Start Guide

### Understanding the Refactoring

The refactoring addresses several key issues in the current fog CLI:

- **Monolithic command structure** → Modular, organized commands
- **Mixed concerns** → Clear separation of business logic and UI
- **Inconsistent error handling** → Structured, user-friendly errors
- **Limited testability** → Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- **Poor flag management** → Organized, validated flag groups

### Implementation Order

The tasks must be implemented in a specific order due to dependencies:

```
1. Command Structure (Foundation)
   ↓
2. Business Logic Extraction
   ↓
3. Flag Management ← 5. Error Handling
   ↓              ↙
4. Output and UI Standardization
   ↓
6. Testing Infrastructure
```

### Key Benefits

**For Developers:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable architecture
- Consistent patterns
- Easy to extend and modify

**For Users:**
- Better error messages with suggestions
- Consistent command patterns
- Progress indication for long operations
- Multiple output formats (JSON, table, etc.)

**For Maintainers:**
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Structured error handling
- Clear debugging information
- Performance monitoring

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting the refactoring, ensure you have:

- Go 1.19+ installed
- Understanding of the current fog CLI structure
- Access to the codebase
- Test environment for AWS integration

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)

Start with the foundational tasks:

1. **Read the [Implementation Plan](cmd-refactor-implementation-plan.md)** for complete timeline
2. **Begin with [Task 1](cmd-refactor-task-1-command-structure-reorg.md)** - Command Structure
3. **Follow with [Task 2](cmd-refactor-task-2-business-logic-extraction.md)** - Business Logic
4. **Implement [Task 5](cmd-refactor-task-5-error-handling.md)** (partial) - Error Handling

### Phase 2: User Experience (Weeks 4-6)

Focus on user-facing improvements:

1. **[Task 3](cmd-refactor-task-3-flag-management.md)** - Flag Management
2. **[Task 4](cmd-refactor-task-4-output-ui-standardization.md)** - Output and UI
3. **Complete [Task 5](cmd-refactor-task-5-error-handling.md)** - Error Handling

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (Weeks 7-8)

Ensure reliability and maintainability:

1. **[Task 6](cmd-refactor-task-6-testing-infrastructure.md)** - Testing Infrastructure
2. **Complete migration of remaining commands**
3. **Performance testing and optimization**

## File Organization

- Benchmark critical operations

### Getting Help

1. **Review the specific task document** for detailed guidance
2. **Check the implementation plan** for timeline and dependencies
3. **Examine code examples** in each task document
4. **Follow testing patterns** from the testing infrastructure task

## Contributing

### Adding New Tasks

If additional refactoring tasks are needed:

1. Follow the existing task document template
2. Define clear objectives and success criteria
3. Include comprehensive code examples
4. Update the implementation plan
5. Consider dependencies and timeline impact

### Improving Documentation

- Keep code examples up to date
- Add clarifications based on implementation experience
- Update success criteria as needed
- Enhance troubleshooting sections

## Conclusion

This refactoring project will transform the fog CLI into a modern, maintainable, and user-friendly tool. The comprehensive documentation provides clear guidance for implementation while ensuring quality and reliability.

The key to success is following the planned approach, implementing tasks in the correct order, and maintaining focus on both technical excellence and user experience.

For detailed implementation guidance, start with the [Implementation Plan](cmd-refactor-implementation-plan.md) and then dive into the individual task documents.
